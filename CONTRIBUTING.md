# Rules of contributing to the project

For anyone wanting to help me develop the bot, you can always contribute.

One rule is - do not try to contribute anything harmful or something that you haven't tested yourself.
If you're sure that your contribution will work perfectly fine - start a pull request or leave a suggestion in comments to the file you want to edit.
